# DarkSwap Phase 3 Consolidated Work List

This document provides a comprehensive list of tasks for Phase 3 of the DarkSwap project, focusing on implementing the web interface, relay server, WebAssembly bindings, and TypeScript library.

## Overview

Phase 3 builds on the completed Phase 1 (Core SDK) and Phase 2 (CLI and Daemon) to create a web-based user interface and supporting infrastructure. The goal is to make DarkSwap accessible through web browsers while maintaining the security and decentralization of the platform.

## Components

### 1. Relay Server (darkswap-relay)

The relay server provides DTLS/ICE connectivity and circuit relay v2 support for NAT traversal.

- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Create crate structure with proper dependencies
  - [ ] Set up logging and configuration
  - [ ] Implement command-line interface

- [ ] **Circuit Relay Implementation**
  - [ ] Port circuit relay implementation from Subfrost
  - [ ] Adapt for WebRTC instead of QUIC
  - [ ] Implement relay discovery and registration

- [ ] **WebRTC Support**
  - [ ] Implement DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)
  - [ ] Add ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)
  - [ ] Integrate with STUN/TURN servers

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Create Docker container
  - [ ] Set up deployment scripts
  - [ ] Deploy to p2p.darkswap.xyz

### 2. WebAssembly Bindings (darkswap-web-sys)

The WebAssembly bindings allow the Rust code to run in web browsers.

- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Configure wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack
  - [ ] Set up build scripts
  - [ ] Create npm package structure

- [ ] **Core Bindings**
  - [ ] Create JavaScript API for Rust code
  - [ ] Implement event handling
  - [ ] Add wallet connection functionality

- [ ] **WebRTC Integration**
  - [ ] Create WebRTC transport for browsers
  - [ ] Implement connection management
  - [ ] Add signaling mechanism

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Optimize critical paths
  - [ ] Implement web workers for heavy computation
  - [ ] Add caching mechanisms

### 3. TypeScript Library (darkswap-lib)

The TypeScript library provides a JavaScript/TypeScript API for web applications.

- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
  - [ ] Create build scripts
  - [ ] Set up testing framework

- [ ] **Core Functionality**
  - [ ] Create type definitions for core data structures
  - [ ] Implement API client for daemon interaction
  - [ ] Add order management functions

- [ ] **Wallet Integration**
  - [ ] Implement wallet connection
  - [ ] Add transaction signing
  - [ ] Create balance management

- [ ] **Event System**
  - [ ] Implement event handling
  - [ ] Add subscription mechanism
  - [ ] Create event filtering

### 4. Web Interface (darkswap-app)

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the DarkSwap network.

- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Update package.json with required dependencies
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript and ESLint
  - [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS

- [ ] **Core UI Components**
  - [ ] Implement responsive layout system
  - [ ] Create theme provider with dark/light mode
  - [ ] Develop reusable UI components

- [ ] **State Management**
  - [ ] Implement context providers
  - [ ] Create reducers for different state slices
  - [ ] Add persistence layer

- [ ] **Page Implementation**
  - [ ] Create trade page
  - [ ] Implement orders page
  - [ ] Develop settings page
  - [ ] Add about page

- [ ] **Advanced Components**
  - [ ] Implement orderbook visualization
  - [ ] Create trade form
  - [ ] Add wallet integration UI
  - [ ] Develop market data display

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for UI components
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for pages
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical flows

## Timeline

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Week 1 | Project Setup and Relay Server | Basic relay server, Web project structure |
| Week 2 | WebAssembly Bindings and Core Components | WebAssembly bindings, Core UI components |
| Week 3 | TypeScript Library and State Management | TypeScript library structure, State management |
| Week 4 | SDK Integration and Advanced Components | WASM integration, Trade form, Wallet UI |
| Week 5 | Page Implementation and Testing | Trade page, Orders page, Component tests |
| Week 6 | Integration, Optimization, and Documentation | Complete web interface, Documentation |

## Dependencies

1. The web interface depends on the TypeScript library
2. The TypeScript library depends on the WebAssembly bindings
3. The WebAssembly bindings depend on the SDK (completed in Phase 1)
4. The relay server depends on the P2P networking code (completed in Phase 1)

## Success Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered successful when:

1. Users can access the web interface from major browsers
2. The web interface can connect to the P2P network using WebRTC
3. Users can create and take orders through the web interface
4. The relay server provides reliable NAT traversal
5. The application works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebRTC NAT traversal issues | High | Medium | Implement circuit relay and use STUN/TURN servers |
| WASM performance issues | Medium | Medium | Optimize critical paths and use web workers |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Implement feature detection and fallback mechanisms |
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Create clear interfaces and comprehensive tests |

## Next Steps After Phase 3

After completing Phase 3, the project will move on to Phase 4 (Testing and Refinement) and Phase 5 (Documentation and Release).
