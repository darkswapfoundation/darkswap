## Introduction

The DarkSwap WebAssembly integration allows the DarkSwap SDK to be used in web applications. However, loading a WebAssembly module can be expensive, especially on mobile devices or slow connections. To improve the user experience, we've implemented several performance optimizations.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique where resources are only loaded when they're needed. In the context of WebAssembly, this means that the WebAssembly module is only loaded when a function that requires it is called. This can significantly improve the initial page load time, especially for pages that don't immediately need the WebAssembly functionality.

We've implemented lazy loading for the DarkSwap WebAssembly module using the `LazyDarkSwapClient` class. This class extends the base `DarkSwapClient` class and overrides its methods to only load the WebAssembly module when a method that requires it is called.

## WebAssembly Module Caching

Once a WebAssembly module is loaded, it's cached in memory to avoid loading it again. This can significantly improve the performance of subsequent calls to functions that require the WebAssembly module.

We've implemented WebAssembly module caching using the `WasmLoader` utility. This utility provides functions for loading, caching, and managing WebAssembly modules.

## Performance Metrics

To measure the impact of these optimizations, we've added performance metrics to the `LazyDarkSwapDemo` component. These metrics show the time it takes to initialize the client, load the WebAssembly module, and perform various operations.

## Implementation Details

### WasmLoader

The `WasmLoader` utility provides the following functions:

- `loadWasmModule`: Loads a WebAssembly module from the specified path and caches it.
- `preloadWasmModule`: Preloads a WebAssembly module without waiting for it to be needed.
- `clearWasmModuleCache`: Clears the WebAssembly module cache.
- `getWasmModuleCacheSize`: Returns the number of modules in the cache.
- `isWasmModuleCached`: Checks if a WebAssembly module is cached.

### LazyDarkSwapClient

The `LazyDarkSwapClient` class extends the base `DarkSwapClient` class and overrides its methods to only load the WebAssembly module when a method that requires it is called. It uses the `WasmLoader` utility to load and cache the WebAssembly module.

### LazyDarkSwapDemo

The `LazyDarkSwapDemo` component demonstrates the lazy loading functionality. It shows the time it takes to initialize the client, load the WebAssembly module, and perform various operations.

## Usage

To use the lazy loading functionality, simply use the `LazyDarkSwapClient` class instead of the base `DarkSwapClient` class:

```typescript
import { LazyDarkSwapClient } from './utils/LazyDarkSwapClient';

// Create a new lazy-loaded DarkSwap client
const client = new LazyDarkSwapClient();

// Initialize the client (this doesn't load the WebAssembly module yet)
await client.initialize();

// The WebAssembly module will be loaded when a method that requires it is called
const address = await client.getAddress();
```

## Future Optimizations

Here are some potential future optimizations:

### Streaming Compilation

WebAssembly modules can be compiled while they're being downloaded, which can significantly improve the loading time. This can be implemented using the `WebAssembly.compileStreaming` function.

### SIMD Instructions

WebAssembly SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions can significantly improve the performance of certain operations, especially those that involve vector or matrix operations. This can be implemented by compiling the Rust code with the `wasm-bindgen` feature `enable-simd`.

### Background Loading

WebAssembly modules can be loaded in a background thread using Web Workers, which can improve the responsiveness of the application. This can be implemented by creating a Web Worker that loads the WebAssembly module and communicates with the main thread using message passing.

### Code Splitting

Large WebAssembly modules can be split into smaller modules that are loaded on demand. This can be implemented using dynamic imports and the `WebAssembly.instantiate` function.

### Preloading

WebAssembly modules can be preloaded when the browser is idle, which can improve the performance of subsequent calls to functions that require the WebAssembly module. This can be implemented using the `requestIdleCallback` function.
