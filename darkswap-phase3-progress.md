# DarkSwap Phase 3 Progress Report

## Overview

Phase 3 of the DarkSwap project has focused on enhancing the P2P network capabilities, implementing the relay server infrastructure, and improving the overall robustness of the system. This document summarizes the key accomplishments and deliverables completed so far in Phase 3.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. DarkSwap Relay Server Implementation

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive WebRTC transport and circuit relay system for the DarkSwap P2P network. This implementation enables peers to connect to each other even when behind NATs, using WebRTC for browser-to-browser communication and circuit relay for NAT traversal.

#### Core Components Implemented:

- **WebRTC Manager (`webrtc.rs`)**: Handles WebRTC connections and data channels, manages ICE candidate exchange and SDP negotiation, and provides connection state tracking and error handling.

- **Circuit Relay Manager (`circuit_relay.rs`)**: Implements relay functionality for peers that can't connect directly, manages circuit creation, reservation, and cleanup, and enforces bandwidth limits and connection tracking.

- **Signaling Server (`signaling.rs`)**: Provides WebSocket-based signaling for WebRTC connection establishment, handles peer registration and message routing, and facilitates SDP offer/answer exchange and ICE candidate sharing.

- **Authentication System (`auth.rs`)**: Implements JWT-based authentication for peers, provides token generation and validation, and supports role-based access control.

- **Rate Limiting (`rate_limit.rs`)**: Protects against DoS attacks, implements connection, message, and bandwidth rate limiting, and provides configurable limits and time windows.

- **Metrics Server (`metrics.rs`)**: Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring, tracks connection, circuit, and message statistics, and provides health check endpoints.

- **Configuration System (`config.rs`)**: Loads configuration from TOML files, provides sensible defaults, and supports environment variable overrides.

- **Server Coordinator (`server.rs`)**: Ties together all components, manages component lifecycle, and handles startup and shutdown.

#### Deployment and Configuration:

- **Build Script (`build.sh`)**: Builds the relay server in debug or release mode, generates certificates for WebRTC, and runs the relay server with the specified configuration.

- **Certificate Generator (`generate-certs.sh`)**: Generates self-signed certificates for WebRTC, with configurable options for certificate details.

- **Configuration File (`config.toml`)**: Provides comprehensive configuration options with sensible defaults.

- **Environment Variables (`.env.example`)**: Shows available environment variables with examples for each setting.

- **Systemd Service (`darkswap-relay.service`)**: System service for running on Linux servers with security hardening.

- **Docker Support**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment.

- **Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)**: Script for deploying the relay server to a remote server.

- **Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)**: Configuration for monitoring the relay server with Prometheus.

### 2. SDK Integration with Relay Server

We have integrated the DarkSwap SDK with the relay server, enabling applications to use relay connections when direct connections are not possible.

#### Components Implemented:

- **Relay Manager (`relay_manager.rs`)**: Manages connections to relay servers, establishes relay circuits between peers, and sends and receives data through relay connections.

- **P2P Network Integration**: Updated the P2PNetwork class to integrate with the relay manager, with methods for relay connections.

- **Example Application (`relay_example.rs`)**: Demonstrates how to use the relay functionality in the SDK.

### 3. Client-Side Components

- **JavaScript Client Library (`darkswap-relay-client.js`)**: Provides a simple API for web applications to connect to the relay server and establish WebRTC connections with other peers.

- **Example Web Application (`example.html`)**: Demonstrates how to use the client library in a web application.

### 4. Documentation and Testing

- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation for the relay server, including installation and usage instructions, configuration options, and security considerations.

- **REMAINING_CHECKLIST.md**: Detailed list of remaining tasks for the relay server.

- **REMAINING_TASKS_UPDATED.md**: Updated list of remaining tasks with more details.

## Technical Details

### WebRTC Transport

The WebRTC transport implementation provides:

1. **Connection Management**: Tracks WebRTC connections with proper state management
2. **NAT Traversal**: Uses STUN/TURN servers to help peers connect through NATs
3. **Data Channels**: Creates and manages data channels for peer-to-peer communication
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for WebRTC connections

Key features:
- Connection state tracking (New, Connecting, Connected, Disconnected, Failed, Closed)
- ICE candidate gathering and exchange
- SDP offer/answer exchange
- Data channel creation and management
- Connection timeout handling

### Circuit Relay

The circuit relay implementation provides:

1. **Relay Protocol**: Implements the circuit relay protocol for indirect connections
2. **Bandwidth Management**: Limits bandwidth usage for relay connections
3. **Reservation System**: Allows peers to reserve relay slots
4. **Connection Tracking**: Tracks active relay connections and their state

Key features:
- Circuit creation and management
- Bandwidth limiting and tracking
- Circuit reservation system
- Circuit cleanup and expiration

### Signaling Server

The signaling server implementation provides:

1. **WebSocket API**: WebSocket-based signaling server for WebRTC connection establishment
2. **SDP Exchange**: Facilitates SDP offer/answer exchange between peers
3. **ICE Candidate Exchange**: Helps peers exchange ICE candidates
4. **Peer Discovery**: Allows peers to discover each other

Key features:
- Peer registration and management
- SDP offer/answer exchange
- ICE candidate exchange
- Integration with circuit relay

### Authentication and Security

The authentication system provides:

1. **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure authentication for peers
2. **Role-based Access Control**: Different permission levels for different peers
3. **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke tokens for security incidents
4. **Token Refresh**: Mechanism for refreshing tokens

The rate limiting system provides:

1. **Connection Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of connections per peer
2. **Message Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of messages per peer
3. **Bandwidth Rate Limiting**: Limits the bandwidth usage per peer
4. **Configurable Limits**: Limits can be configured per peer or globally

### Monitoring and Metrics

The metrics server provides:

1. **Prometheus Metrics**: Exposes metrics in Prometheus format
2. **Connection Metrics**: Tracks the number of connections, peers, and circuits
3. **Bandwidth Metrics**: Tracks bandwidth usage per peer and circuit
4. **Health Checks**: Provides health check endpoints for monitoring

## Integration Flow

The integration between the DarkSwap SDK and the relay server works as follows:

1. **Relay Server Discovery**:
   - The SDK converts relay server multiaddrs to WebSocket URLs
   - It establishes WebSocket connections to the relay servers

2. **Peer Connection**:
   - When a direct WebRTC connection fails, the SDK falls back to relay
   - It sends a relay request to the relay server
   - The relay server creates a circuit and assigns a unique ID
   - Both peers are notified of the circuit creation

3. **Data Exchange**:
   - Data is sent through the relay server using the circuit ID
   - The relay server forwards the data to the destination peer
   - Bandwidth limits and rate limiting are enforced by the relay server

## Next Steps

While significant progress has been made in Phase 3, there are still some tasks remaining:

1. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for all components
2. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation for all public functions
3. **Security Enhancements**: Complete token extraction in authentication middleware
4. **Performance Optimizations**: Implement connection pooling and optimize data forwarding
5. **Monitoring**: Create Grafana dashboards and add alerting rules

## Conclusion

Phase 3 has made significant progress in enhancing the P2P network capabilities of DarkSwap, particularly in enabling connections between peers behind NATs. The relay server implementation and SDK integration provide a robust foundation for the DarkSwap P2P network, ensuring that it can function effectively in challenging network environments.
