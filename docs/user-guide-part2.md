# DarkSwap User Guide - Part 2: Trading

## Trading

Trading on DarkSwap is straightforward once you understand the basics. This section will guide you through the process of trading Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes on the platform.

### Understanding the Order Book

The order book is the central component of the trading interface. It displays all current buy and sell orders for a selected trading pair.

#### Order Book Components

- **Buy Orders (Bids)**: Displayed in green on the left side of the order book. These are orders from traders willing to buy the base asset.
- **Sell Orders (Asks)**: Displayed in red on the right side of the order book. These are orders from traders willing to sell the base asset.
- **Price**: The price at which the order is placed.
- **Amount**: The quantity of the base asset being bought or sold.
- **Total**: The total value of the order in the quote asset.

#### Reading the Order Book

- The **spread** is the difference between the highest bid (buy order) and the lowest ask (sell order).
- **Market depth** refers to the volume of orders at each price level. Higher market depth indicates higher liquidity.
- **Order clustering** shows where most orders are concentrated, which can indicate support and resistance levels.

### Creating Buy Orders

To create a buy order:

4. Enter the price at which you want to buy the base asset.
5. Enter the amount of the base asset you want to buy.

#### Buy Order Types

- **Limit Order**: Specifies the maximum price you're willing to pay for the asset. The order will be filled at your specified price or better.

#### Sell Order Types

- **Limit Order**: Specifies the minimum price you're willing to accept for the asset. The order will be filled at your specified price or better.

### Managing Your Orders
