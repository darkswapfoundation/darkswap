# DarkSwap User Guide - Part 3: Wallet Management

## Wallet Management

Managing your wallet is a crucial aspect of using DarkSwap. This section will guide you through the process of depositing funds, withdrawing funds, viewing your transaction history, and implementing security best practices.

### Depositing Funds

To deposit funds into your DarkSwap wallet:

1. Navigate to the "Wallet" section in the main navigation.
2. Click on the "Deposit" tab.
3. Select the asset you want to deposit (e.g., BTC, RUNE, ALKANE).
4. A deposit address will be generated for you.
5. Send the desired amount to this address from your external wallet.
6. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.
7. Once confirmed, the funds will be credited to your DarkSwap wallet.

#### Deposit Confirmations

Different assets require different numbers of confirmations before they are credited to your account:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: 3 confirmations
- **Runes**: 3 confirmations (same as Bitcoin)
- **Alkanes**: 3 confirmations (same as Bitcoin)

#### Deposit Limits

There are no minimum deposit limits on DarkSwap. However, very small deposits may not be economical due to network fees.

### Withdrawing Funds

To withdraw funds from your DarkSwap wallet:

1. Navigate to the "Wallet" section in the main navigation.
2. Click on the "Withdraw" tab.
3. Select the asset you want to withdraw (e.g., BTC, RUNE, ALKANE).
4. Enter the withdrawal address.
5. Enter the amount you want to withdraw.
6. Review the network fee.
7. Click "Withdraw" to initiate the withdrawal.
8. Confirm the withdrawal using two-factor authentication (if enabled).
9. Wait for the transaction to be processed and confirmed on the blockchain.

#### Withdrawal Confirmations

Withdrawals are processed as soon as possible, but may require manual approval for large amounts. Once processed, the transaction will be broadcast to the network and will be subject to normal blockchain confirmation times.

#### Withdrawal Limits

Withdrawal limits depend on your account verification level:

- **Unverified Accounts**: 0.1 BTC equivalent per day
- **Verified Accounts**: 1 BTC equivalent per day
- **Fully Verified Accounts**: 10 BTC equivalent per day

2. Click on the "Transactions" tab.
3. You'll see a list of all your transactions, including:
   - Deposits
   - Withdrawals
   - Trades
   - Fee payments

For each transaction, you can view:

- Transaction type
- Asset
- Amount
- Status
- Date and time
- Transaction ID (TXID)

You can filter transactions by:

- Type (deposit, withdrawal, trade, fee)

- Status (pending, completed, failed)
- Date range

### Security Best Practices

Securing your wallet is of utmost importance. Here are some best practices to keep your funds safe:

#### Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account:

1. Navigate to the "Settings" section.
2. Click on the "Security" tab.
3. Click "Enable 2FA".
4. Follow the instructions to set up 2FA using an authenticator app.
5. Store the backup codes in a safe place.

#### Use a Strong Password

Your password should be:

- At least 12 characters long
- Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Not be used for any other service

#### Secure Your Recovery Phrase

If you're using the built-in wallet:

- Write down your recovery phrase on paper (not digitally).
- Store it in a secure location, preferably in a fireproof safe.
- Consider making multiple copies and storing them in different secure locations.
- Never share your recovery phrase with anyone.

#### Verify Withdrawal Addresses

Always double-check withdrawal addresses before confirming a withdrawal:

- Verify the entire address, not just the beginning and end.
- Consider sending a small test amount first.
- Use the address book feature for frequently used addresses.

#### Monitor Your Account

Regularly check your account for any unauthorized activity:

- Set up email notifications for logins and withdrawals.
- Review your transaction history periodically.
- Log out when you're not using the platform.

#### Use a Hardware Wallet

For large amounts, consider using a hardware wallet:

1. Purchase a hardware wallet from a reputable manufacturer.
2. Set it up according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Connect it to DarkSwap using the "Connect Hardware Wallet" option in the wallet section.

#### Be Wary of Phishing Attempts

Protect yourself from phishing:

- Always check the URL before logging in (https://darkswap.io).
- Don't click on links in emails claiming to be from DarkSwap.
- DarkSwap will never ask for your password or recovery phrase.
