8. **Verify transaction details**: Always verify transaction details before confirming transactions.

### Privacy Considerations

DarkSwap is designed with privacy in mind, but there are still some considerations:

3. **Order privacy**: Your orders are visible to other users of the DarkSwap network.
4. **Trade privacy**: Your trades are visible to the counterparty and may be visible to other users of the DarkSwap network.

To enhance your privacy:

1. **Use a VPN**: Use a VPN to hide your IP address.
2. **Use Tor**: Use Tor to route your traffic through the Tor network.
3. **Use multiple addresses**: Use a new address for each transaction.
4. **Use privacy-enhancing techniques**: Use CoinJoin, PayJoin, or other privacy-enhancing techniques.
