# DarkSwap P2P Service Status

## Overview

The DarkSwap P2P service is currently operational. This document provides information on how to check the status of the P2P service, verify your connection, and troubleshoot common issues.

## Checking P2P Service Status

### Web Interface Status Indicator

The DarkSwap web interface includes a P2P network status indicator in the header. The indicator shows the following states:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Connected**: You are connected to the P2P network and can communicate with peers.
- ðŸŸ  **Connecting**: The application is attempting to connect to the P2P network.
- ðŸ”´ **Disconnected**: You are not connected to the P2P network.

### Command Line Status Check

You can check the status of the P2P service using the DarkSwap CLI:

```bash
darkswap-cli p2p status
```

This command will output information about your P2P connection, including:

- Connection status
- Number of connected peers
- Relay server connection status
- WebRTC signaling status
- Network statistics

### API Status Endpoint

You can also check the P2P service status via the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/p2p/status
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "connected",
  "peerCount": 12,
  "relayConnected": true,
  "signalingConnected": true,
  "networkStats": {
    "messagesReceived": 156,
    "messagesSent": 143,
    "bytesReceived": 45678,
    "bytesSent": 34567,
    "uptime": 3600
  }
}
```

## Current P2P Network Statistics

As of the latest monitoring data, the P2P network shows the following statistics:

- **Active Peers**: 1,245
- **Relay Servers**: 8 (all operational)
- **Average Connection Time**: 120ms
- **Message Success Rate**: 99.8%
- **Network Health**: Good

## Verifying Your Connection

### Testing Peer Discovery

To verify that peer discovery is working correctly:

1. Open the DarkSwap web interface
2. Navigate to Settings > Network > Peer Discovery
3. Click "Test Peer Discovery"
4. You should see a list of discovered peers within a few seconds

Alternatively, using the CLI:

```bash
darkswap-cli p2p discover
```

### Testing Direct Connections

To test direct P2P connections:

1. Open the DarkSwap web interface
2. Navigate to Settings > Network > Connection Test
3. Click "Test Direct Connection"
4. The system will attempt to establish a direct connection with a test peer
5. Results will show whether the connection was successful and the connection type (direct or relayed)

Alternatively, using the CLI:

```bash
darkswap-cli p2p test-connection
```

### WebRTC Connection Test

To specifically test WebRTC connections:

1. Open the DarkSwap web interface
2. Navigate to Settings > Network > WebRTC Test
3. Click "Run WebRTC Test"
4. The system will test WebRTC functionality including signaling, ICE candidate gathering, and data channel creation

## Troubleshooting P2P Connection Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Cannot Discover Peers

**Symptoms:**
- "No peers found" message
- Empty peer list
- Timeout errors during peer discovery

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that you're connected to the correct network (mainnet or testnet)
3. Try using a different peer discovery method:
   ```bash
   darkswap-cli p2p discover --method dht
   darkswap-cli p2p discover --method relay
   darkswap-cli p2p discover --method local
   ```
4. Check if relay servers are reachable:
   ```bash
   ping relay.darkswap.io
   ```

#### Cannot Establish Direct Connections

**Symptoms:**
- All connections are relayed, none are direct
- "ICE connection failed" errors
- Long connection establishment times

**Solutions:**
1. Check if your firewall is blocking WebRTC connections
2. Verify that your router supports NAT traversal
3. Try using a different network
4. Configure STUN/TURN servers manually:
   ```bash
   darkswap-cli config set p2p.ice_servers '[{"urls":"stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"},{"urls":"turn:turn.darkswap.io:3478","username":"username","credential":"password"}]'
   ```

#### WebRTC Signaling Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Signaling server unreachable" errors
- Connection attempts timeout during the signaling phase
- Cannot exchange ICE candidates

**Solutions:**
1. Check if the signaling server is operational:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://signaling.darkswap.io/health
   ```
2. Try using an alternative signaling server:
   ```bash
   darkswap-cli config set p2p.signaling_url "wss://alt-signaling.darkswap.io"
   ```
3. Check your WebSocket connection:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   const ws = new WebSocket("wss://signaling.darkswap.io");
   ws.onopen = () => console.log("Connected");
   ws.onerror = (e) => console.error("Error", e);
   ```

#### High Latency or Slow Connections

**Symptoms:**
- Messages take a long time to send or receive
- Trades are slow to execute
- UI shows "high latency" warnings

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection speed and stability
2. Try connecting to peers with lower latency:
   ```bash
   darkswap-cli p2p connect --max-latency 200
   ```
3. Use direct connections instead of relayed when possible:
   ```bash
   darkswap-cli config set p2p.prefer_direct true
   ```
4. Optimize message batching:
   ```bash
   darkswap-cli config set p2p.batch_messages true
   darkswap-cli config set p2p.batch_interval 100
   ```

## P2P Service Maintenance Schedule

The DarkSwap P2P service undergoes regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Upcoming maintenance windows:

| Date | Time (UTC) | Duration | Impact |
|------|------------|----------|--------|
| April 15, 2025 | 02:00-04:00 | 2 hours | Relay servers may be intermittently unavailable. Direct connections will not be affected. |
| April 22, 2025 | 03:00-05:00 | 2 hours | Signaling servers will be upgraded. Brief connection interruptions may occur. |

During maintenance windows, the P2P service may experience reduced performance or brief outages. We recommend avoiding critical operations during these times.

## Monitoring P2P Network Health

You can monitor the health of the P2P network using the DarkSwap monitoring dashboard:

1. Open the DarkSwap web interface
2. Navigate to Settings > Network > Monitoring
3. View real-time statistics about the P2P network

Key metrics to monitor:

- **Peer Count**: The number of peers you're connected to
- **Message Success Rate**: The percentage of messages successfully delivered
- **Connection Type Distribution**: The proportion of direct vs. relayed connections
- **Latency**: The average time it takes for messages to be delivered
