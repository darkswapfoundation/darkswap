# DarkSwap Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit report provides an assessment of the DarkSwap platform's security posture, focusing on the security enhancements implemented in Phase 3. The audit was conducted to identify potential security vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of the implemented security controls, and provide recommendations for further improvements.

Overall, the DarkSwap platform demonstrates a strong security posture with comprehensive security controls implemented across multiple layers. The security enhancements in Phase 3 have significantly improved the platform's resilience against common web application vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Key Findings

- **Strong Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation is implemented on both client and server sides.
- **Effective Rate Limiting**: Sophisticated rate limiting protects against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Robust Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control secures sensitive operations.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Standardized error handling prevents information leakage.
- **Detailed Logging**: Extensive logging facilitates monitoring and incident response.

### Recommendations

While the platform demonstrates strong security controls, there are opportunities for further enhancement:

1. **Implement Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.
2. **Enable HTTPS by Default**: Configure HTTPS for all communications.
3. **Add Additional Security Headers**: Implement recommended security headers.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Input Validation

#### Strengths

- Comprehensive validation utility with type-safe validators
- Domain-specific validators for Bitcoin addresses, runes, and alkanes
- Composable validators for complex validation rules
- Detailed error messages for user feedback
- Validation on both client and server sides

#### Vulnerabilities

- **[Low] Potential for Bypass**: Some validators could be bypassed if not properly integrated into all input paths.
- **[Info] Error Message Verbosity**: Some error messages may be too detailed, potentially revealing implementation details.

#### Recommendations

1. Ensure all input paths use the validation utility
2. Review error messages to balance usability with security
3. Add additional validators for emerging attack vectors

### 2. Rate Limiting

#### Strengths

- Sliding window algorithm for accurate rate limiting
- Different limits for authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Path-based exclusion and inclusion
- Standard rate limit headers in responses
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

#### Vulnerabilities

- **[Medium] IP Spoofing**: Rate limiting based on IP addresses can be bypassed using IP spoofing or proxies.
- **[Low] Distributed Attacks**: Rate limiting may not be effective against distributed denial-of-service attacks.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement additional client identification mechanisms beyond IP addresses
2. Consider implementing more advanced rate limiting algorithms for critical endpoints
3. Add rate limiting at the infrastructure level for better protection against DDoS attacks

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **[Low] Limited Role Granularity**: Current role system is binary (has role or doesn't have role).

#### Recommendations

1. Provide guidance on secure token storage in client applications
2. Implement refresh token mechanism for better user experience
3. Enhance role system with more granular permissions
4. Implement token revocation mechanism
5. Add two-factor authentication for sensitive operations

### 4. Error Handling

#### Strengths

#### Recommendations

1. Ensure consistent error codes across all endpoints
2. Document all error codes and messages
3. Add more detailed internal error logging for debugging

### 5. Logging

#### Strengths

- Request and response logging with unique request IDs
- Configurable logging of request and response bodies
- Path-based filtering for logging
- Performance metrics (request duration)
- Client information logging (IP, user agent)

#### Vulnerabilities

- **[Medium] Sensitive Data Logging**: Potential for sensitive data to be logged if not properly configured.
- **[Low] Log Storage**: No guidance on secure log storage and rotation.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement data masking for sensitive information in logs
2. Provide guidance on secure log storage and rotation
3. Add log aggregation and analysis capabilities
4. Implement alerting for suspicious activities

### 6. Configuration Management

#### Strengths

- Comprehensive configuration system with sensible defaults
- Environment-specific configuration
- Secure handling of sensitive configuration values
- Configuration validation

#### Vulnerabilities

- **[Medium] Default Secret Key**: Default secret key in configuration could be used in production if not changed.
- **[Low] Configuration Documentation**: Some configuration options are not well documented.

#### Recommendations

1. Enforce changing default secret keys in production
2. Improve documentation for all configuration options
3. Add validation for security-critical configuration values
4. Implement secure configuration storage

### 7. Test Coverage
