## Core Components

### DarkSwap SDK

The SDK is the core of the DarkSwap system. It provides all the functionality needed for P2P trading:

- **Network Module**: Handles P2P networking using libp2p
- **Orderbook Module**: Manages orders and matches trades
- **Trade Module**: Handles trade execution
- **Bitcoin Utils Module**: Manages Bitcoin transactions and PSBTs
- **Config Module**: Handles configuration
- **Error Module**: Provides error handling
- **Types Module**: Defines common types
- **WASM Module**: Provides WebAssembly bindings for browser integration

The SDK is designed to be used by both the CLI and daemon, as well as directly by applications through its WASM bindings.

### DarkSwap CLI

The CLI provides a command-line interface for interacting with the SDK. It allows users to:

- Create and cancel orders
- Take orders
- List orders
- Get market data
- Connect wallets
- Start the daemon

The CLI is designed to be simple and intuitive, with clear commands and options.

### DarkSwap Daemon

The daemon is a background service that hosts an orderbook and facilitates trades. It provides a REST API for interacting with the system, making it easy to integrate with other applications.

The daemon's key features include:

- **REST API**: Provides endpoints for order management and market data
- **Event System**: Notifies clients of events such as order creation, cancellation, and filling
- **Wallet Integration**: Connects to Bitcoin wallets for transaction signing
- **P2P Node**: Participates in the P2P network for orderbook distribution and trade execution

### Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with DarkSwap. It is built with React and integrates with the SDK through its WASM bindings.

The web interface includes:

- **Orderbook Visualization**: Displays the orderbook in a user-friendly way
- **Trade Interface**: Allows users to create and take orders
- **Wallet Integration**: Connects to Bitcoin wallets for transaction signing
- **Settings**: Allows users to configure the system

## Interactions

### SDK and CLI

The CLI uses the SDK to perform operations such as creating orders, taking orders, and getting market data. It provides a simple interface for users to interact with the SDK.

### SDK and Daemon

The daemon uses the SDK to participate in the P2P network, manage the orderbook, and execute trades. It provides a REST API for clients to interact with the system.

### SDK and Web Interface

The web interface uses the SDK through its WASM bindings to interact with the P2P network, manage orders, and execute trades. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.

### P2P Network

The P2P network is the backbone of DarkSwap. It enables nodes to discover each other, distribute orderbook updates, and execute trades. The network uses libp2p with various protocols:

- **GossipSub**: For orderbook distribution
- **WebRTC**: For browser compatibility
- **Direct Connections**: For trade execution
- **Circuit Relay**: For NAT traversal

## Design Decisions

### Modular Design

DarkSwap uses a modular design pattern, where each component has a clear responsibility and interfaces with other components through well-defined APIs. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently

### Event-Driven Architecture

DarkSwap uses an event-driven architecture for handling asynchronous operations and communication between components:

- **Decoupling**: Components communicate through events rather than direct calls
- **Scalability**: Event processing can be parallelized
- **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations improve user experience

### Repository Pattern

For data management, DarkSwap uses the repository pattern to abstract the storage and retrieval of data:

- **Abstraction**: Hides the details of data storage
- **Flexibility**: Allows changing the storage implementation without affecting other components
- **Testability**: Enables easy mocking for tests

### Strategy Pattern

DarkSwap uses the strategy pattern to allow different implementations of key algorithms:

- **Flexibility**: Different strategies can be selected at runtime
- **Extensibility**: New strategies can be added without modifying existing code
- **Configurability**: Strategies can be configured based on user preferences

## Security Considerations

### Transaction Validation

DarkSwap implements comprehensive transaction validation:

- **Input Validation**: Verify all inputs belong to the expected parties
- **Output Validation**: Ensure outputs match the trade parameters
- **Signature Validation**: Verify all signatures are valid
- **Fee Validation**: Ensure fees are reasonable and as expected

### Peer Authentication

DarkSwap implements robust peer authentication:

- **Public Key Authentication**: Verify peer identities using public key cryptography
- **Order Signature Validation**: Ensure orders are signed by the claimed maker
- **Trade Intent Validation**: Verify trade intents are signed by the taker

### Network Security

DarkSwap implements several network security measures:

- **Encrypted Communications**: All P2P communications are encrypted
- **Peer Validation**: Peers are validated before establishing connections
- **Message Validation**: All messages are validated before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DoS attacks through rate limiting

## Performance Optimization

### WASM Optimization

DarkSwap optimizes the WASM compilation for browser performance:

- **Code Size Optimization**: Minimize WASM binary size
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage
- **Computation Optimization**: Optimize CPU-intensive operations

### Orderbook Optimization

DarkSwap optimizes the orderbook for efficient querying and updates:

- **Indexing**: Multiple indices for different query patterns
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Incremental Updates**: Only send changes rather than full orderbook

### Network Optimization

DarkSwap optimizes the P2P network for efficiency:

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections to reduce overhead
- **Message Batching**: Combine multiple small messages
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize important messages
- **Compression**: Compress large messages

## Deployment Considerations

### SDK Deployment

The SDK can be deployed in various ways:

- **Native Library**: For desktop applications
- **WASM Module**: For browser applications
- **NPM Package**: For JavaScript applications

### CLI Deployment

The CLI can be deployed as a standalone binary for various platforms:

- **Linux**: For Linux users
- **macOS**: For macOS users
- **Windows**: For Windows users

### Daemon Deployment

The daemon can be deployed as a service on various platforms:

- **Systemd Service**: For Linux servers
- **Docker Container**: For containerized deployments
- **Cloud Service**: For cloud deployments

### Web Interface Deployment

The web interface can be deployed as a static website:

- **Static Hosting**: For simple deployments
- **CDN**: For global distribution
- **IPFS**: For decentralized hosting

## Conclusion

DarkSwap's architecture is designed to be modular, secure, and efficient. By leveraging modern design patterns and technologies, DarkSwap provides a robust platform for P2P trading of Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes. The clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces make it easy to extend and enhance the system as needed.
