## Timeline Overview

| Phase | Duration | Start | End |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| Phase 1: Core SDK Implementation | 8 weeks | Month 1, Week 1 | Month 2, Week 4 |
| Phase 2: CLI and Daemon Implementation | 4 weeks | Month 3, Week 1 | Month 3, Week 4 |
| Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation | 6 weeks | Month 3, Week 3 | Month 4, Week 4 |
| Phase 4: Testing and Refinement | 4 weeks | Month 5, Week 1 | Month 5, Week 4 |
| Phase 5: Documentation and Release | 4 weeks | Month 6, Week 1 | Month 6, Week 4 |

Note: Phases 2 and 3 overlap by 2 weeks, as the CLI and daemon implementation can be completed while starting work on the web interface.

## Milestones and Key Deliverables

| Milestone | Deliverable | Timeline |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Core SDK Completion | Functional DarkSwap SDK with all core features | End of Month 2 |
| CLI and Daemon Completion | Functional CLI and daemon for interacting with the SDK | End of Month 3 |
| Web Interface Completion | Functional web interface for DarkSwap | End of Month 4 |
| Testing Completion | Comprehensive test suite and optimizations | End of Month 5 |
| Release | Complete DarkSwap platform with documentation | End of Month 6 |

## Resource Requirements

| Phase | Resource Requirements |
|-------|----------------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 Rust developers |
| Phase 2 | 1-2 Rust developers |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 React/TypeScript developers |
| Phase 4 | 1-2 QA engineers, 1-2 developers |
| Phase 5 | 1 technical writer, 1-2 developers |

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebRTC NAT traversal issues | High | Medium | Implement circuit relay and use STUN/TURN servers |
| WASM performance issues | Medium | Medium | Optimize critical paths and use web workers |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Implement feature detection and fallback mechanisms |
| Bitcoin integration complexity | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing and validation |
| Resource availability | Medium | Low | Flexible timeline and resource allocation |

## Success Criteria

The DarkSwap project will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create and take orders for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes
2. Orders are distributed through the P2P network
3. Trades are executed securely using PSBTs
4. The platform works on desktop and web browsers
5. The platform is well-documented and easy to use

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines the plan for developing the DarkSwap platform over a 6-month period. By following this roadmap, the project can be completed in a structured and efficient manner, with clear milestones and deliverables.

The roadmap is flexible and can be adjusted as needed based on progress, resource availability, and changing requirements. Regular reviews of the roadmap should be conducted to ensure that the project is on track and to make any necessary adjustments.
