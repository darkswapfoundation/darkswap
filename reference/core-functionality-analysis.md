# DarkSwap Core Functionality Analysis

This document provides a detailed analysis of the core functionality of DarkSwap, including orderbook management, trade execution, and wallet integration.

## Orderbook Management

The orderbook is a central component of DarkSwap. It manages orders and facilitates trade matching.

### Order Structure

An order in DarkSwap consists of the following components:

- **Order ID**: A unique identifier for the order
- **Maker**: The address of the order creator
- **Base Asset**: The asset being bought or sold (e.g., BTC)
- **Quote Asset**: The asset used for pricing (e.g., RUNE:123)
- **Side**: Buy or sell
- **Amount**: The amount of the base asset
- **Price**: The price in terms of the quote asset
- **Status**: Open, partially filled, filled, cancelled, or expired
- **Timestamp**: When the order was created
- **Expiry**: When the order expires
- **Signature**: A cryptographic signature to verify the order's authenticity

### Order Creation

When a user creates an order, the following steps occur:

1. **Validation**: The order is validated to ensure it has valid parameters
2. **ID Generation**: A unique ID is generated for the order
3. **Signing**: The order is signed by the maker
4. **Storage**: The order is stored in the local orderbook
5. **Broadcasting**: The order is broadcast to the P2P network

### Order Distribution

Orders are distributed through the P2P network using GossipSub:

1. **Subscription**: Nodes subscribe to the orderbook topic
2. **Publishing**: When a node creates or updates an order, it publishes it to the topic
3. **Receiving**: When a node receives an order, it validates it and adds it to its local orderbook
4. **Propagation**: The order is propagated to other nodes in the network

### Order Matching

Unlike traditional exchanges, DarkSwap does not have a central matching engine. Instead, users manually select orders to take:

1. **Order Selection**: A user selects an order from the orderbook
2. **Amount Specification**: The user specifies how much of the order to take
3. **Trade Initiation**: The user initiates a trade with the maker

### Order Management

DarkSwap provides several features for managing orders:

- **Order Cancellation**: Users can cancel their orders
- **Order Updating**: Users can update their orders (e.g., change price or amount)
- **Order Expiry**: Orders automatically expire after a specified time
- **Order Filtering**: Users can filter orders by various criteria

## Trade Execution

Trade execution is the process of completing a trade between two parties.

### Trade Flow

The trade flow in DarkSwap consists of the following steps:

1. **Trade Intent**: The taker sends a trade intent to the maker
2. **PSBT Creation**: Both parties create PSBTs representing their side of the trade
3. **PSBT Exchange**: The maker and taker exchange PSBTs
4. **PSBT Combination**: The PSBTs are combined into a single PSBT
5. **PSBT Signing**: Both parties sign the combined PSBT
6. **Transaction Extraction**: The final transaction is extracted from the PSBT
7. **Transaction Broadcast**: The transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network

### PSBT Handling

PSBTs (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) are a key component of DarkSwap's trade execution:

- **PSBT Creation**: Creating PSBTs that represent the trade
- **PSBT Validation**: Validating PSBTs to ensure they are valid
- **PSBT Signing**: Signing PSBTs with the user's private key
- **PSBT Combination**: Combining PSBTs from multiple parties
- **Transaction Extraction**: Extracting the final transaction from a PSBT

### Security Measures

DarkSwap implements several security measures for trade execution:

- **Transaction Validation**: Ensuring transactions are valid and match the trade parameters
- **Signature Verification**: Verifying signatures to ensure authenticity
- **Fee Validation**: Ensuring fees are reasonable and as expected
- **Timeout Handling**: Handling timeouts to prevent stuck trades

### Error Handling

DarkSwap provides robust error handling for trade execution:

- **Network Errors**: Handling network failures and retries
- **Validation Errors**: Providing clear error messages for validation failures
- **Timeout Errors**: Handling timeouts and providing appropriate feedback
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Allowing users to recover from failed trades

## Wallet Integration

Wallet integration is essential for DarkSwap, as it enables users to sign transactions and manage their assets.

### Wallet Types

DarkSwap supports multiple wallet types:

- **In-Memory Wallet**: A simple wallet for testing and development
- **File Wallet**: A wallet stored in a file
- **Hardware Wallet**: Integration with hardware wallets (planned)

### Wallet Functionality

DarkSwap's wallet integration provides the following functionality:

- **Address Generation**: Generating Bitcoin addresses
- **Transaction Signing**: Signing Bitcoin transactions
- **UTXO Management**: Managing UTXOs for transaction creation
- **Balance Checking**: Checking wallet balances

### Security Considerations

Wallet integration includes several security considerations:

- **Private Key Security**: Ensuring private keys are never exposed
- **Signing Security**: Ensuring signing is done securely
- **Transaction Validation**: Validating transactions before signing
- **Fee Control**: Allowing users to control transaction fees

### User Experience

DarkSwap aims to provide a seamless wallet integration experience:

- **Simple Connection**: Making it easy to connect wallets

## P2P Communication

P2P communication is the backbone of DarkSwap, enabling nodes to discover each other, distribute orderbook updates, and execute trades.

### Message Types

DarkSwap uses several types of messages for P2P communication:

- **Order Messages**: For orderbook updates
- **Trade Messages**: For trade execution
- **Ping/Pong Messages**: For connection maintenance

### Message Handling

Messages are handled through a robust pipeline:

1. **Reception**: Messages are received from the P2P network
2. **Validation**: Messages are validated to ensure they are valid
3. **Processing**: Messages are processed based on their type
4. **Response**: Responses are sent back to the sender if needed

### Security Measures

P2P communication includes several security measures:

- **Message Validation**: Ensuring messages are valid
- **Signature Verification**: Verifying signatures to ensure authenticity
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing DoS attacks
- **Peer Validation**: Validating peers before accepting messages

### Reliability Measures

DarkSwap implements several measures to ensure reliable P2P communication:

- **Retries**: Retrying failed messages
