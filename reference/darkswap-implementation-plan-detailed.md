## Dependencies and Critical Path

The following dependencies exist between components:

1. The CLI and daemon depend on the core SDK
2. The web interface depends on the SDK's WASM bindings
3. Runes and alkanes support depend on the Bitcoin utilities module
4. The trade module depends on the orderbook module
5. The orderbook module depends on the network module

The critical path for the project is:

1. Complete the core SDK implementation
2. Implement runes and alkanes support
3. Create the CLI and daemon
4. Develop the web interface
5. Conduct comprehensive testing
6. Create documentation and prepare for release

## Resource Allocation

The following resources are needed for the project:

1. **Core SDK Development**: 2-3 Rust developers
2. **CLI and Daemon Development**: 1-2 Rust developers
3. **Web Interface Development**: 2-3 React/TypeScript developers
4. **Testing**: 1-2 QA engineers
5. **Documentation**: 1 technical writer

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified:

1. **WebRTC NAT Traversal**: WebRTC NAT traversal can be unreliable in certain network configurations
   - Mitigation: Implement circuit relay and use STUN/TURN servers

2. **WASM Performance**: WebAssembly can have performance overhead compared to native code
   - Mitigation: Optimize critical paths and use web workers

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Different browsers have different levels of WebRTC support
   - Mitigation: Implement feature detection and fallback mechanisms

4. **Bitcoin Integration**: Bitcoin integration can be complex and error-prone
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and validation

## Conclusion

This implementation plan outlines all the tasks needed to complete the DarkSwap project. By following this plan, the project can be completed in a structured and efficient manner, with clear milestones and deliverables.

The plan is flexible and can be adjusted as needed based on progress, resource availability, and changing requirements. Regular reviews of the plan should be conducted to ensure that the project is on track and to make any necessary adjustments.
