# DarkSwap Project Brief

## Project Overview

DarkSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes. It enables users to trade assets directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. The platform is built on Bitcoin's technology stack and leverages the power of PSBTs (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) for secure trading.

## Core Requirements

1. **Decentralized P2P Trading**
   - Enable direct peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries
   - Implement a decentralized orderbook using P2P networking
   - Support direct connections between traders

2. **Bitcoin, Runes, and Alkanes Support**
   - Support trading of Bitcoin (BTC)
   - Support trading of runes (fungible tokens on Bitcoin)
   - Support trading of alkanes (protocol built on top of runes)

3. **Orderbook-Based Trading**
   - Implement an orderbook for listing and matching orders
   - Support limit orders with specified prices
   - Support order cancellation and expiry

4. **Secure Trading**
   - Use PSBTs for secure trade execution
   - Implement comprehensive transaction validation
   - Ensure atomicity of trades

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Support desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Support web browsers through WASM compilation
   - Support mobile browsers (iOS, Android)

## Architecture

DarkSwap consists of several components:

1. **darkswap-sdk**
   - Core functionality for DarkSwap
   - P2P networking using rust-libp2p
   - Orderbook management
   - Trade execution
   - Bitcoin integration
   - WASM bindings for browser integration

2. **darkswap-cli**
   - Command-line interface for interacting with DarkSwap
   - Order creation and management
   - Trade execution
   - Wallet integration

3. **darkswap-daemon**
   - Background service for hosting an orderbook and facilitating trades
   - REST API for interacting with the service
   - Event system for monitoring system events

4. **web**
   - Web interface for DarkSwap
   - React-based UI
   - Integration with the SDK through WASM

## Technical Stack

1. **Backend**
   - Rust for core functionality
   - rust-libp2p for P2P networking
   - rust-bitcoin for Bitcoin integration
   - WASM for browser integration

2. **Frontend**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - React for UI components
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Vite for build tooling

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**
   - Intuitive user interface
   - Clear workflow for creating and taking orders
   - Comprehensive error messages

2. **Performance**
   - Fast order creation and matching
   - Efficient P2P networking
   - Responsive UI

3. **Security**
   - Secure trade execution
   - Protection against common attacks
   - Clear security model

4. **Reliability**
   - Robust error handling
   - Graceful degradation in challenging network environments
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Project Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core Implementation**
   - Implement core SDK functionality
   - Create CLI and daemon
   - Set up project structure and documentation

2. **Phase 2: Web Interface**
   - Implement web interface
   - Integrate with SDK through WASM
   - Add responsive design

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Refinement**
   - Conduct thorough testing
   - Fix bugs and issues
   - Optimize performance

4. **Phase 4: Documentation and Release**
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Prepare for release
   - Create tutorials and examples

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - Users can create and take orders
   - Orders are distributed through the P2P network
   - Trades are executed securely

2. **Performance**
   - Orders are distributed quickly
   - Trades are executed efficiently
   - UI is responsive

3. **Security**
   - Trades are atomic and secure
   - Transactions are properly validated
   - Users have control over their funds

4. **Usability**
   - Users can easily create and take orders
   - Error messages are clear and helpful
   - UI is intuitive and responsive

## Constraints

1. **Technical Constraints**
   - Must work with Bitcoin's transaction model
   - Must support P2P networking in browsers
   - Must be compatible with existing Bitcoin wallets

2. **Security Constraints**
   - Must ensure trade atomicity
   - Must validate all transactions
   - Must protect against common attacks

3. **Usability Constraints**
   - Must be usable by non-technical users
   - Must provide clear error messages
   - Must work on various platforms

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **P2P Networking Challenges**
   - Risk: NAT traversal issues
   - Mitigation: Implement circuit relay and STUN/TURN

2. **Bitcoin Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Complex transaction validation
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and validation

3. **Browser Compatibility Challenges**
   - Risk: Limited browser APIs
   - Mitigation: Use WebRTC and WASM
