## Subfrost Analysis

We've conducted an in-depth analysis of the Subfrost project, focusing on its P2P networking implementation and circuit relay functionality. Key findings include:

1. **Transport Layer**:
   - Subfrost uses QUIC as its transport protocol, specifically focusing on QUIC-V1 (RFC 9000) with fallback support for QUIC draft-29
   - Enhanced QUIC configuration with permissive timeouts and increased stream limits
   - Consistent handling of multiaddresses across the codebase

2. **Circuit Relay Implementation**:
   - Implements the Circuit Relay v2 protocol for NAT traversal
   - Reservation management for relay connections
   - Connection establishment through relays

3. **Network Behavior**:
   - Combined network behaviors (Gossipsub, Kademlia DHT, etc.)
   - Comprehensive event system
   - Peer identity verification

These findings have informed our implementation of WebRTC transport and circuit relay functionality for DarkSwap.

## PintSwap Analysis

We've also analyzed the PintSwap project to understand its architecture and how it can be adapted for DarkSwap. Key findings include:

1. **P2P Networking**:
   - PintSwap uses js-libp2p with WebRTC transport
   - GossipSub protocol for message broadcasting
   - Peer discovery using bootstrap nodes and DHT

2. **Orderbook Management**:
   - Local orderbook with order broadcasting
   - Order matching and expiry
   - Order status tracking

3. **Trade Execution**:
   - Trade negotiation protocol
   - Transaction creation and signing
   - Transaction broadcasting

These findings have informed our implementation of the orderbook management and trade execution for DarkSwap.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **WebRTC vs. QUIC**:
   - Decision: Use WebRTC for P2P networking instead of QUIC
   - Rationale: WebRTC is widely supported in browsers, while QUIC requires custom implementation
   - Impact: Need to port Subfrost's circuit relay implementation to use WebRTC

2. **rust-libp2p vs. js-libp2p**:
   - Decision: Use rust-libp2p for the core SDK and compile to WebAssembly for browser support
   - Rationale: rust-libp2p provides better performance and safety
   - Impact: Need to create WebAssembly bindings for the Rust code

3. **Circuit Relay Implementation**:
   - Decision: Port Subfrost's circuit relay implementation to WebRTC
   - Rationale: Subfrost's implementation is robust and well-tested
   - Impact: Need to adapt the implementation to use WebRTC instead of QUIC

4. **PSBT-Based Trading**:
   - Decision: Use PSBTs for trade execution
   - Rationale: PSBTs are the standard way to create and sign Bitcoin transactions
   - Impact: Need to implement PSBT creation, signing, and validation

### Product Decisions

1. **Asset Support**:
   - Decision: Support Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes
   - Rationale: These are the primary assets in the Bitcoin ecosystem
   - Impact: Need to implement support for all three asset types

2. **User Experience**:
   - Decision: Focus on simplicity and usability
   - Rationale: Make the platform accessible to non-technical users
   - Impact: Need to design a user-friendly interface

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Decision: Web-first approach with desktop support
   - Rationale: Maximize accessibility and reach
   - Impact: Need to ensure browser compatibility

## Implementation Progress

We've made significant progress on the core SDK implementation:

1. **Network Module**: Implemented P2P networking with WebRTC transport and circuit relay functionality.
2. **Orderbook Module**: Implemented orderbook management with order matching and expiry.
3. **Trade Module**: Implemented trade execution with PSBT creation and signing.
4. **Bitcoin Utilities**: Implemented wallet integration and PSBT handling.
5. **WASM Bindings**: Implemented WebAssembly bindings for browser integration.

The next steps are to complete the core SDK implementation with runes and alkanes support, and start working on the CLI and daemon.

## Conclusion

The DarkSwap project has made significant progress on the core implementation phase. The P2P networking functionality with WebRTC support has been implemented, along with orderbook management, trade execution, and Bitcoin utilities. The next steps are to complete the core SDK implementation with runes and alkanes support, and start working on the CLI and daemon.

With the integration of concepts from Subfrost and PintSwap, DarkSwap is well-positioned to become a powerful decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes.
