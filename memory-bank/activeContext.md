# DarkSwap Active Context

## Current Focus (Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation - IN PROGRESS)

The current development focus is on completing **Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation**, with a specific emphasis on integrating and verifying the core backend components:
-   **CLI P2P Commands**: Implementing the necessary `p2p` subcommands in `darkswap-cli` to enable scripted testing (`scripts/test-p2p-network.sh`).
-   **P2P/Relay Testing & Verification**: Rigorously testing the `darkswap-p2p` and `darkswap-relay` components, including direct/relayed connections, connection pooling, authentication, and encryption. Running integration tests between these components and the `darkswap-sdk`.
-   **SDK Integration**: Ensuring the `darkswap-sdk` correctly utilizes the P2P and relay functionalities.
-   **Web Interface Testing**: Completing unit, integration (SDK via WASM, API/WebSocket), and end-to-end tests for the web interface.
-   **Build System**: Ensuring all components (SDK, CLI, P2P, Relay, Web) build correctly and tests pass within the CI environment.
-   **Documentation**: Finalizing guides related to P2P setup, testing, and SDK integration.
-   **Deployment**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines and configuring environments.

## Recent Changes

*(No major *completed* changes explicitly mentioned regarding CLI/SDK/P2P/Relay builds/tests since the last update, focus remains on ongoing implementation and verification)*

-   **Web Interface Setup**: React project initialized, core UI components built, responsive design implemented.
-   **Relay Server**: Basic structure set up, circuit relay logic ported, DTLS/ICE support added.
-   **WASM/JS Integration**: `wasm-bindgen`/`wasm-pack` configured, JS API created, browser WebRTC support integrated, TypeScript library structured, state management set up.
-   **Web Pages**: Initial versions of Trade, Orders, and Settings pages implemented.
-   **Real-Time Data**: API/WebSocket clients and contexts implemented.
-   **Security/Performance/Monitoring**: Foundational elements added (auth, encryption, metrics, pooling, WebSockets).

## Active Decisions

1. **Authentication Method Selection**:
   - Decision to support multiple authentication methods for flexibility
   - Default to shared key authentication for simplicity
   - Allow configuration of authentication requirements

2. **Encryption Algorithm Choices**:
   - Selected AES-GCM-256 as the default encryption algorithm
   - Added ChaCha20-Poly1305 as an alternative for specific use cases
   - Prioritized authenticated encryption for all communications

3. **Key Management Approach**:
   - Implemented automatic key rotation for enhanced security
   - Used ephemeral keys for forward secrecy
   - Added configurable TTLs for keys and tokens

4. **Monitoring Strategy**:
   - Focused on Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
   - Selected key metrics for tracking system health
   - Implemented alerting for critical issues

## Current Challenges (Phase 3 Remaining Tasks)

1.  **CLI P2P Command Implementation**: Actively working on adding the `p2p` subcommands to `darkswap-cli` to unblock the `scripts/test-p2p-network.sh` script.
2.  **P2P/Relay Test Execution**: Running and debugging integration tests for `darkswap-p2p` and `darkswap-relay`, including scenarios involving the SDK. Verifying connection stability, auth, and encryption.
3.  **Web E2E Test Implementation**: Need to implement E2E tests covering P2P trading flows, including scenarios requiring relay connections.
4.  **Testing Coverage**: Ensuring sufficient unit and integration test coverage for newly added CLI commands and P2P/Relay interactions within the SDK.
5.  **Documentation**: Requires completion of guides detailing P2P network setup, testing procedures, and SDK integration points for networking.
6.  **Deployment Setup**: CI/CD pipelines need to incorporate build and test steps for all components, including P2P/Relay integration tests.
7.  **Connectivity Reliability**: Continue refining WebRTC NAT traversal and relay mechanisms based on test results.

## Next Steps (Focus on Completing Phase 3)

1.  **Complete CLI P2P Commands**: Finish implementing the `p2p` subcommand in `darkswap-cli`.
2.  **Run P2P Test Script**: Execute `scripts/test-p2p-network.sh` using the updated CLI and debug any failures in P2P/Relay components or their interaction with the SDK.
3.  **Develop/Run Integration Tests**: Create and run integration tests specifically targeting SDK <-> P2P <-> Relay interactions.
4.  **Develop/Run Web E2E Tests**: Implement and run E2E tests for P2P trading flows via the web interface.
5.  **Finalize Network Documentation**: Write and review documentation for P2P/Relay setup, testing, and SDK usage.
6.  **Configure CI/CD**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to build all components and run all relevant tests (unit, integration, E2E, P2P script).
