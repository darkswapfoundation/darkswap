2. **Component Modularization**: Factoring out common P2P code that can be shared between the relay, daemon, and browser components.
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensuring the codebase can be built for both wasm and x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu targets.
4. **TypeScript Integration**: Creating a TypeScript library (darkswap-lib) that provides the same functionality as the Rust SDK.
5. **Core SDK Implementation**: Completing the core SDK with runes and alkanes support, comprehensive unit tests, and performance optimizations.

## Conclusion

This detailed implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for creating a modular P2P architecture for DarkSwap with WebRTC support. The plan is divided into four phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables, ensuring a systematic approach to the development process.

The modular component structure, with shared code between Rust and TypeScript implementations, will enable a consistent experience across all platforms while maximizing code reuse. The darkswap-relay server will provide DTLS/ICE connectivity and circuit relay v2 support for NAT traversal, allowing peers behind NATs to connect to each other.

With this redesigned architecture, DarkSwap will be well-positioned to become a powerful decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes, accessible from both web browsers and native applications.
