# DarkSwap Active Context

## Current Focus (Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation - IN PROGRESS)

The current development focus is on completing **Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation**. While many initial milestones are complete (React setup, core components, WASM bindings, state management, basic page implementation), the remaining work centers on:
-   **Testing**: Completing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the web interface and its integration with the SDK via WASM.
-   **Documentation**: Finalizing API, component, user, and developer guides.
-   **Deployment**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines and configuring environments.
-   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Ensuring accessibility, browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, and internationalization for the web interface.
-   **Security & Performance**: Although initial work was done (auth, encryption, metrics, pooling), further hardening and optimization are planned for Phase 4, but ongoing vigilance is required.

## Recent Changes

### Recent Changes (Reflecting Completed Phase 3 Milestones)

-   **Web Interface Setup**: React project initialized, core UI components built, responsive design implemented.
-   **Relay Server**: Basic structure set up, circuit relay logic ported, DTLS/ICE support added.
-   **WASM/JS Integration**: `wasm-bindgen`/`wasm-pack` configured, JS API created, browser WebRTC support integrated, TypeScript library structured, state management set up.
-   **Web Pages**: Initial versions of Trade, Orders, and Settings pages implemented.
-   **Real-Time Data**: API/WebSocket clients and contexts implemented.
-   **Security/Performance/Monitoring**: Foundational elements added (auth, encryption, metrics, pooling, WebSockets).

## Active Decisions

1. **Authentication Method Selection**:
   - Decision to support multiple authentication methods for flexibility
   - Default to shared key authentication for simplicity
   - Allow configuration of authentication requirements

2. **Encryption Algorithm Choices**:
   - Selected AES-GCM-256 as the default encryption algorithm
   - Added ChaCha20-Poly1305 as an alternative for specific use cases
   - Prioritized authenticated encryption for all communications

3. **Key Management Approach**:
   - Implemented automatic key rotation for enhanced security
   - Used ephemeral keys for forward secrecy
   - Added configurable TTLs for keys and tokens

4. **Monitoring Strategy**:
   - Focused on Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
   - Selected key metrics for tracking system health
   - Implemented alerting for critical issues

## Current Challenges (Phase 3 Remaining Tasks)

1.  **Missing CLI P2P Commands**: The `darkswap-cli` tool lacks the necessary `p2p` subcommands required by the `scripts/test-p2p-network.sh` verification script.
2.  **Testing Coverage**: Need to complete unit tests, integration tests (API/WebSocket clients), and implement E2E tests (trade flow, performance).
2.  **Documentation**: Requires completion of API docs, component docs, user/developer guides, and architecture overview.
3.  **Deployment Setup**: CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and environment configurations need to be established.
4.  **Web Frontend Polish**: Address accessibility, browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, and internationalization.
5.  **WASM Performance**: Ongoing need to monitor and potentially optimize WASM performance.
6.  **Connectivity Reliability**: Continue refining WebRTC NAT traversal and relay mechanisms.

## Next Steps (Focus on Completing Phase 3)

1.  **Implement CLI P2P Commands**: Add the `p2p` subcommand and its actions (`discover`, `connect`, `send`, etc.) to `darkswap-cli` to enable P2P network testing via the script.
2.  **Complete Testing**: Finish all planned unit, integration, and E2E tests for Phase 3 deliverables, including running the P2P test script successfully.
2.  **Finalize Documentation**: Write and review all required documentation for Phase 3 components.
3.  **Set Up Deployment**: Implement CI/CD, Dockerization, and environment configurations.
4.  **Address Frontend Polish**: Implement accessibility features, test/fix browser compatibility, optimize mobile layout, and set up i18n.
