## Conclusion

The DarkSwap project is making steady progress towards creating a modular and cross-platform P2P trading system. Recent fixes to the WebSocket event handling in the daemon and verification of the OrderId import have improved the stability of the system. The next steps are to complete the runes and alkanes support, port the Subfrost P2P stack, create the modular architecture, implement WebAssembly bindings, and develop the TypeScript library.

With the redesigned architecture, DarkSwap will be well-positioned to become a powerful decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes, accessible from both web browsers and native applications.
