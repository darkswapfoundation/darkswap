## Conclusion

The DarkSwap project has made significant progress with the completion of Phase 2, which included the implementation of the CLI and daemon components. The CLI now provides a comprehensive set of commands for managing orders, trades, and wallet operations, while the daemon offers a robust REST API and WebSocket interface for interacting with the DarkSwap SDK.

Recent achievements include:
1. Implementation of the CLI with commands for order creation, cancellation, listing, and taking
2. Completion of the daemon with REST API, WebSocket support, and service management
3. Enhancement of the SDK with new methods like `get_all_orders` and improved event processing
4. Creation of comprehensive documentation for installation and usage

The next steps are to update the remaining integration tests, complete the runes and alkanes support, begin Phase 3 with the implementation of the relay server and web interface, implement WebAssembly bindings, develop the TypeScript library, and enhance testing and documentation.

With the completion of Phase 2, DarkSwap is now closer to becoming a powerful decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes, accessible from both web browsers and native applications.
