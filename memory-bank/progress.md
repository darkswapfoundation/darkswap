## Conclusion

The DarkSwap project has made significant progress on the core implementation phase. The P2P networking functionality with WebRTC support has been implemented, along with orderbook management, trade execution, and Bitcoin utilities. The next steps are to complete the core SDK implementation with runes and alkanes support, and start working on the CLI and daemon.

We've conducted in-depth analyses of Subfrost and PintSwap to inform our implementation, and we've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the project. With the integration of concepts from Subfrost and PintSwap, DarkSwap is well-positioned to become a powerful decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes.
