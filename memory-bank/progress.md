# DarkSwap Progress

## Overall Status

The project is currently **IN PROGRESS** with **Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation** as the active focus. Phases 1 (Core SDK) and 2 (CLI/Daemon) are marked as COMPLETED.

## What Works (Based on Existing Components & Documentation)

*   **Core SDK (`darkswap-sdk`)**: Foundational logic for wallets, order books, trades, runes, and alkanes is implemented.
*   **P2P Layer (`darkswap-p2p`)**:
    *   Rust crate exists using libp2p and WebRTC.
    *   Includes implementations for connection pooling, basic encryption, authentication, and metrics hooks.
    *   WebRTC transport is implemented.
*   **Relay Server (`darkswap-relay`)**:
    *   Standalone Rust server exists.
    *   Basic circuit relay logic (inspired by Subfrost) is implemented.
    *   DTLS/ICE support for WebRTC NAT traversal is included.
*   **Web Integration**:
    *   WASM bindings (`darkswap-web-sys`) and TypeScript library (`darkswap-lib`) are set up.
    *   React frontend (`web`) has initial components related to WebRTC status, connection management, and P2P networking pages.
*   **Basic Patterns**: Core P2P/Relay patterns like Circuit Relay and Connection Pooling are defined architecturally.

## What's Left to Build / Verify (Current Task Focus)

*   **Relay Functionality Verification**:
    *   Confirm `darkswap-relay` reliably facilitates NAT traversal.
    *   Test connection success rates for peers requiring relay.
    *   Verify relay discovery and selection mechanisms.
*   **P2P Network Stability & Features Verification**:
    *   Test the stability and reliability of direct WebRTC connections.
    *   Test the stability and reliability of connections established via the relay.
    *   Verify the effectiveness of connection pooling.
    *   Confirm peer authentication and end-to-end encryption work correctly over both direct and relayed connections.
    *   Validate message passing and protocol interactions over the P2P network.
*   **Integration Testing**:
    *   Ensure seamless integration between `darkswap-sdk`, `darkswap-p2p`, `darkswap-relay`.
    *   Verify the web frontend (`web`) correctly interacts with the P2P network via WASM bindings (`darkswap-web-sys`, `darkswap-lib`).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**:
    *   Implement and run E2E tests simulating trading workflows over the P2P network (including relayed scenarios).
*   **Performance & Monitoring**:
    *   Establish baseline performance metrics for P2P connections (direct & relayed). (Full optimization planned for Phase 4).
    *   Verify that P2P/Relay metrics (peer count, connection success, relay load) are correctly reported.

## Current Status Detail

*   The foundational P2P (`darkswap-p2p`) and Relay (`darkswap-relay`) components are built but require rigorous testing and verification, especially in integrated scenarios with the SDK and web frontend.
*   Phase 3 focus includes completing the web interface integration for these network features and ensuring their testability.

## Known Issues & Challenges

*   **Connectivity Reliability**: Explicitly noted as an ongoing challenge. Requires continuous refinement and testing of NAT traversal (WebRTC/ICE/STUN/TURN) and circuit relay mechanisms.
*   **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive integration and E2E tests covering various P2P/Relay scenarios are still needed.
*   **WASM Performance**: Potential impact of WASM execution on network interaction latency needs monitoring.
*   **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent WebRTC behavior across different browsers.
