# DarkSwap Progress

## Overall Status

The project is currently **IN PROGRESS** with **Phase 3: Web Interface Implementation** as the active focus. Phases 1 (Core SDK) and 2 (CLI/Daemon) are marked as COMPLETED.

## What Works (Based on Existing Components & Documentation)

*   **Core SDK (`darkswap-sdk`)**: Foundational logic implemented. Build scripts (`build.sh`) and numerous tests (`tests/`) exist, covering various modules (wallet, trade, runes, alkanes, etc.).
*   **P2P Layer (`darkswap-p2p`)**:
    *   Rust crate exists using libp2p and WebRTC. Build scripts (`build.sh`) and tests (`tests/`) are present.
    *   Implementations for connection pooling, encryption, auth, metrics, WebRTC transport, and circuit relay logic exist but require thorough verification.
*   **Relay Server (`darkswap-relay`)**:
    *   Standalone Rust server exists with build scripts (`build.sh`) and tests (`tests/`).
    *   Circuit relay logic and WebRTC support are implemented but need verification.
*   **CLI (`darkswap-cli`)**: Basic structure exists, but P2P commands are missing/incomplete.
*   **Build System**: Individual component build scripts (`build.sh`) and a top-level `build-all.sh` exist. Basic test execution scripts (`run-tests.sh`, `run-wasm-tests.sh`, etc.) are present.
*   **Web Integration**: WASM bindings (`darkswap-web-sys`), TypeScript library (`darkswap-lib`), and React frontend (`web`) are set up with build/test infrastructure.

## What's Left to Build / Verify (Current Task Focus)

*   **CLI P2P Commands**: Implement the required `p2p` subcommands in `darkswap-cli`.
*   **Build Verification**: Ensure `build-all.sh` and individual component builds succeed consistently in the CI environment.
*   **Test Execution & Verification**:
    *   Run all existing unit and integration tests for `darkswap-sdk`, `darkswap-p2p`, `darkswap-relay`, and `darkswap-cli` and ensure they pass.
    *   Execute the P2P network test script (`scripts/test-p2p-network.sh`) using the updated CLI and verify its success.
    *   Run integration tests specifically targeting SDK <-> P2P <-> Relay interactions.
    *   Run existing WASM/Web tests and ensure they pass.
*   **P2P/Relay Functionality Verification**:
    *   Confirm reliable NAT traversal via `darkswap-relay`.
    *   Verify stability of direct and relayed P2P connections (`darkswap-p2p`).
    *   Validate connection pooling, authentication, and encryption mechanisms in `darkswap-p2p`.
*   **E2E Testing**: Implement and run E2E tests for P2P trading flows (web and potentially CLI).

## Current Status Detail

*   Focus is on solidifying the backend components (SDK, CLI, P2P, Relay) by ensuring their builds are stable and tests are comprehensive and passing.
*   Implementation of CLI P2P commands is underway to enable scripted P2P network testing.
*   Integration testing between SDK, P2P, and Relay is a key priority.
*   Existing build scripts and test suites provide a foundation but require execution and verification across the integrated system.

## Known Issues & Challenges

*   **CLI P2P Commands Incomplete**: Blocking the execution of `scripts/test-p2p-network.sh`.
*   **Build Stability**: Potential for build failures when integrating changes across multiple Rust crates (SDK, P2P, Relay, CLI). Requires verification via `build-all.sh` and CI.
*   **Test Coverage Gaps**: While tests exist, comprehensive integration tests covering SDK <-> P2P <-> Relay interactions need development/verification. E2E tests for P2P flows are missing.
*   **Connectivity Reliability**: Verifying the robustness of WebRTC/Relay connections under various network conditions remains a core challenge requiring thorough testing.
