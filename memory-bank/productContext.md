# DarkSwap Product Context

## Product Vision

DarkSwap aims to be the leading decentralized exchange for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes, providing a secure, private, and user-friendly platform for peer-to-peer trading without centralized intermediaries.

## User Problems Solved

### 1. Centralization Risks

**Problem**: Centralized exchanges control user funds, creating risks of hacks, freezes, or mismanagement.
**Solution**: DarkSwap enables direct peer-to-peer trading without any central authority holding user funds.

### 2. Privacy Concerns

**Problem**: Traditional exchanges require KYC and track user activity.
**Solution**: DarkSwap provides privacy-preserving trading with end-to-end encryption and no mandatory identity verification.

### 3. Limited Bitcoin DEX Options

**Problem**: Most DEXs focus on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, with limited Bitcoin support.
**Solution**: DarkSwap is built specifically for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes, providing first-class support for these assets.

### 4. Technical Barriers

**Problem**: Existing decentralized solutions often require technical knowledge.
**Solution**: DarkSwap offers intuitive interfaces (web and CLI) that abstract away technical complexity.

### 5. Network Connectivity Issues

**Problem**: P2P systems often struggle with NAT traversal and connectivity.
**Solution**: DarkSwap implements advanced relay mechanisms and connection management to ensure reliable connectivity.
