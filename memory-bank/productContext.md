# DarkSwap Product Context

This document provides context on why DarkSwap exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.

## Why DarkSwap Exists

DarkSwap exists to address several key challenges in the Bitcoin ecosystem:

1. **Lack of Decentralized Trading Options**: While there are many centralized exchanges for Bitcoin, there are few truly decentralized options that allow users to trade Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes directly with each other without intermediaries.

2. **Need for Privacy and Security**: Centralized exchanges require users to trust third parties with their funds and personal information. DarkSwap eliminates this need by enabling direct peer-to-peer trading.

3. **Limited Support for Runes and Alkanes**: Existing trading platforms have limited support for runes and alkanes, which are emerging as important token standards on Bitcoin.

4. **High Fees and Friction**: Centralized exchanges often charge high fees and introduce friction in the trading process. DarkSwap aims to reduce fees and friction by enabling direct peer-to-peer trading.

5. **Censorship Resistance**: Centralized exchanges are subject to censorship and regulatory pressure. DarkSwap aims to provide a censorship-resistant trading platform.

## Problems DarkSwap Solves

### For Traders

1. **Custody Risk**: DarkSwap eliminates the need to trust third parties with custody of funds, reducing the risk of exchange hacks or insolvency.

3. **High Fees**: DarkSwap reduces fees by eliminating intermediaries and enabling direct peer-to-peer trading.

4. **Limited Asset Support**: DarkSwap supports Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes, providing a comprehensive trading platform for Bitcoin-based assets.
