# DarkSwap System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### Modular Architecture

DarkSwap follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core SDK (darkswap-sdk)**: Contains the fundamental business logic and domain models
2. **CLI Interface (darkswap-cli)**: Provides command-line access to the system
3. **Background Service (darkswap-daemon)**: Handles long-running processes and system integration
4. **P2P Network Layer (darkswap-p2p)**: Manages peer-to-peer communication
5. **Web Interface (web)**: Delivers the browser-based user experience

This modular approach allows for:
- Independent development and testing of components
- Flexibility in deployment configurations
- Clear boundaries between system responsibilities
- Easier maintenance and updates

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture

The system uses a pure peer-to-peer architecture for trading:

1. **Direct Peer Communication**: Users connect and trade directly with each other
2. **No Central Server**: No central authority for matching or executing trades
3. **Distributed Order Book**: Order information is distributed across the network
4. **Relay Nodes**: Special nodes help with NAT traversal but don't control the trading process

### Event-Driven Architecture

Many components use event-driven patterns:

1. **Event Publishers**: Components emit events when state changes
2. **Event Subscribers**: Components react to events from other parts of the system
3. **Event Loops**: Processing loops handle events asynchronously
4. **Message Passing**: Communication between components via message passing

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Used for data access abstraction:

1. **Wallet Repository**: Abstracts wallet storage and retrieval
2. **Order Repository**: Manages order persistence and querying
3. **Peer Repository**: Handles peer information storage

### Factory Pattern

Used for creating complex objects:

1. **Wallet Factory**: Creates appropriate wallet implementations
2. **Connection Factory**: Builds network connections with proper configuration
3. **Order Factory**: Constructs order objects with validation

### Strategy Pattern

Used for interchangeable algorithms:

1. **Authentication Strategies**: Different methods for peer authentication
2. **Encryption Strategies**: Various encryption algorithms
3. **Order Matching Strategies**: Different approaches to matching orders

### Observer Pattern

Used for event notification:

1. **Network Events**: Notifications about peer connections/disconnections
2. **Order Book Updates**: Notifications about order changes
3. **Trade Events**: Notifications about trade progress

### Command Pattern

Used in the CLI and API interfaces:

1. **User Commands**: Encapsulated as command objects
2. **Command Execution**: Standardized execution flow
3. **Command History**: Tracking of executed commands

### Singleton Pattern

Used for system-wide resources:

1. **Connection Pool**: Single instance managing all connections
2. **Configuration Manager**: Central configuration access
3. **Metrics Registry**: Centralized metrics collection

## Communication Patterns

### Circuit Relay Pattern

Used for NAT traversal:

1. **Relay Discovery**: Finding suitable relay nodes
2. **Relay Connection**: Establishing connections through relays
3. **Relay Handshake**: Protocol for setting up relayed connections
4. **Relay Scoring**: Ranking relays by performance and reliability

### Connection Pooling Pattern

Used for efficient connection management:

1. **Connection Reuse**: Reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones
2. **Connection Lifecycle**: Managing the creation, use, and cleanup of connections
3. **Connection Limits**: Enforcing maximum connection counts
4. **Connection Pruning**: Removing idle or expired connections

### Challenge-Response Pattern

Used for authentication:

1. **Challenge Generation**: Creating secure random challenges
2. **Response Verification**: Validating responses to challenges
3. **Token Issuance**: Providing authentication tokens after successful verification

## Concurrency Patterns

### Actor Model

Used for concurrent processing:

1. **Network Actors**: Handle network communication
2. **Order Book Actors**: Process order book updates
3. **Trade Actors**: Manage trade execution
4. **Message Passing**: Communication between actors via messages

### Asynchronous Processing

Used throughout the system:

1. **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations with Rust's async/await
2. **Future Composition**: Combining multiple asynchronous operations
3. **Task Scheduling**: Managing concurrent tasks with tokio

## Security Patterns

### Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security:

1. **Authentication**: Verifying peer identity
2. **Authorization**: Controlling access to system functions
3. **Encryption**: Protecting data confidentiality
4. **Validation**: Checking inputs and transactions
5. **Monitoring**: Detecting suspicious activity

### Principle of Least Privilege

Limiting access rights:

1. **Authorization Levels**: Different permission levels for different operations
2. **Minimal Exposure**: Exposing only necessary functionality
3. **Capability-Based Security**: Access based on held capabilities

### Forward Secrecy

Protecting past communications:

1. **Ephemeral Keys**: Short-lived encryption keys
2. **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of encryption keys
3. **Session Isolation**: Separate keys for different sessions

## Data Patterns

### Immutable Data

Used for critical data:

1. **Transaction Records**: Immutable transaction history
2. **Order History**: Unchangeable record of orders
3. **Event Logs**: Append-only event records

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separation of read and write operations:

1. **Commands**: Operations that change state
2. **Queries**: Operations that read state
3. **Separate Models**: Different models for reading and writing

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Testing

Testing individual components:

1. **Component Tests**: Testing isolated components
2. **Mock Dependencies**: Using mock objects for dependencies
3. **Behavior Verification**: Verifying component behavior

### Integration Testing

Testing component interactions:

1. **Component Integration**: Testing how components work together
2. **Subsystem Testing**: Testing larger subsystems
3. **API Testing**: Testing public APIs

### End-to-End Testing

Testing complete workflows:

1. **User Scenarios**: Testing complete user journeys
2. **Network Simulation**: Simulating P2P network conditions
3. **Performance Testing**: Measuring system performance
