# Remaining Tasks for DarkSwap Relay Server

To have a fully functional relay server, the following tasks need to be completed:

## Core Components

1. **WebRTC Manager Implementation**
   - Create `src/webrtc.rs` to implement the `WebRtcManager` class referenced in other files
   - Implement WebRTC connection establishment and management
   - Add support for handling WebRTC events and callbacks

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete the integration test implementations
   - Add more comprehensive test cases for edge conditions
   - Create test fixtures and mocks for testing without external dependencies

## Configuration and Setup

1. **Environment Variables Support**
   - Add support for configuration via environment variables
   - Create a `.env.example` file with sample configuration

2. **Systemd Service File**
   - Create a systemd service file for running the relay server as a service
   - Add installation instructions for systemd service

## Security Enhancements

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement a proper authentication system for peers
   - Add support for JWT or similar token-based authentication
   - Create an API for managing authentication tokens

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting for signaling and relay connections
   - Add protection against DoS attacks

## Monitoring and Metrics

1. **Prometheus Metrics**
   - Enhance the metrics implementation with more detailed metrics
   - Add Grafana dashboard templates for monitoring

2. **Logging Enhancements**
   - Implement structured logging
   - Add log rotation and archiving

## Documentation

1. **API Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation for the signaling server
   - Document the WebRTC connection flow

2. **Deployment Guide**
   - Create a detailed deployment guide for different environments
   - Add troubleshooting information

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Connection Pooling**
   - Implement connection pooling for WebRTC connections
   - Optimize resource usage for high-load scenarios

2. **Load Testing**
   - Create load testing scripts
   - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks

## Client Integration

1. **JavaScript Client Library**
   - Create a JavaScript client library for browser integration
   - Add examples for using the client library

2. **Mobile Client Support**
   - Add support for mobile clients
   - Test with different mobile browsers and native apps

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement the `WebRtcManager` class in `src/webrtc.rs`
2. Complete the integration tests
3. Add environment variables support
4. Enhance the authentication system
5. Create comprehensive API documentation

These tasks are essential for having a fully functional relay server that can be used in production.
