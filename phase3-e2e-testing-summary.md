# DarkSwap Phase 3 End-to-End Testing Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for the DarkSwap Phase 3 integration. This testing framework ensures that all components of the system work correctly together, providing a solid foundation for the DarkSwap platform.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Playwright Configuration

We created a Playwright configuration file (`web/playwright.config.ts`) that:
- Sets up testing for multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers)
- Configures screenshot and video capture for failed tests
- Sets up the web server to run during tests
- Configures retries and timeouts

### 2. Test Files

We created comprehensive test files for different aspects of the application:

1. **Trade Flow Tests** (`web/e2e/trade-flow.spec.ts`)
   - Tests for creating trade offers
   - Tests for accepting trade offers
   - Tests for cancelling trade offers
   - Tests for form validation
   - Tests for balance checking

2. **Wallet Integration Tests** (`web/e2e/wallet-integration.spec.ts`)
   - Tests for displaying wallet balances
   - Tests for connecting to wallets
   - Tests for signing transactions
   - Tests for handling transaction errors

3. **P2P Network Tests** (`web/e2e/p2p-network.spec.ts`)
   - Tests for displaying peer status
   - Tests for WebSocket connections
   - Tests for relay server connections
   - Tests for peer discovery

4. **Error Handling Tests** (`web/e2e/error-handling.spec.ts`)
   - Tests for network failures
   - Tests for API errors
   - Tests for WebSocket disconnections
   - Tests for validation errors
   - Tests for transaction failures
   - Tests for timeout errors
   - Tests for server errors

### 3. Test Helpers

We created a helper file (`web/e2e/helpers.ts`) with utility functions for:
- Waiting for notifications
- Filling out trade forms
- Connecting to wallets
- Ensuring WebSocket connections
- Mocking API responses
- Formatting balances

### 4. Mock API Server

We set up a mock API server for testing:

1. **Database File** (`web/mock-api/db.json`)
   - Contains mock data for peers, wallet balances, trade offers, and trade history

2. **Routes File** (`web/mock-api/routes.json`)
   - Maps API endpoints to mock data

3. **Middleware File** (`web/mock-api/middleware.js`)
   - Handles custom routes and WebSocket simulation
   - Adds CORS headers
   - Generates dynamic responses

### 5. Scripts and Automation

We created scripts for running the tests:

1. **Setup Script** (`web/setup-e2e-tests.sh`)
   - Installs dependencies
   - Installs Playwright browsers
   - Creates test environment variables
   - Runs the tests

2. **Mock API Script** (`web/start-mock-api.sh`)
   - Starts the mock API server for testing

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`)
   - Sets up continuous integration for the tests
   - Runs tests on push and pull requests
   - Uploads test results as artifacts

## Key Testing Scenarios

The end-to-end tests cover the following key scenarios:

### 1. Trade Flow

- Creating a trade offer with different asset types
- Viewing available trade offers
- Accepting a trade offer
- Cancelling a trade offer
- Validating form inputs
- Checking balances before submitting

### 2. Wallet Integration

- Displaying wallet balances for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes
- Connecting to a wallet
- Signing transactions
- Handling transaction errors
- Refreshing balances

### 3. P2P Network

- Displaying peer status and connected peers
- Connecting to and disconnecting from the relay server
- Copying peer ID to clipboard
- Configuring relay server settings
- Handling reconnection

### 4. Error Handling

- Network failures when creating trade offers
- API errors when accepting trade offers
- WebSocket disconnection and reconnection
- Validation errors in forms
- Transaction failures
- Timeout errors
- Server errors

## How to Run the Tests

To run the end-to-end tests:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd web
   npm install
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

3. Start the mock API server:
   ```
   ./start-mock-api.sh
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```
   npx playwright test
   ```

5. View the test report:
   ```
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

Alternatively, you can use the setup script to do all of this in one step:
```
./setup-e2e-tests.sh
```

## Benefits of End-to-End Testing

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests the entire application from the user's perspective
2. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensures the application works in all supported browsers
3. **Mobile Testing**: Verifies the application works on mobile devices
4. **Regression Testing**: Catches regressions when making changes
5. **Confidence**: Provides confidence that the application works as expected

## Next Steps

With the end-to-end testing framework in place, the following steps are needed to complete the Phase 3 integration:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Create API documentation
   - Create component documentation
   - Create user guides and tutorials

2. **Deployment**:
   - Complete continuous deployment setup
   - Create Docker containers for the relay server
   - Configure production and staging environments

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement input validation
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement proper error handling and logging

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize WebAssembly size
   - Implement React component memoization
   - Add API response caching
   - Implement WebSocket message batching
   - Add lazy loading of components

## Conclusion

The end-to-end testing implementation for DarkSwap Phase 3 provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application. By testing the entire application from the user's perspective, we can catch issues early and ensure a smooth user experience.
