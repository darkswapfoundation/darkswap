## Overview

The DarkSwap Bridge settings allow you to customize various aspects of the bridge, including:

2. The page displays various settings categories, each with its own set of options.

The theme will change immediately when you toggle the switch. The setting is stored in your browser's local storage, so it will persist even if you close the browser.

### Log Level

The log level setting controls the verbosity of the logs generated by the bridge.

- **Error**: Only log errors
- **Warning**: Log errors and warnings
- **Info**: Log errors, warnings, and informational messages
- **Debug**: Log errors, warnings, informational messages, and debug messages
- **Trace**: Log everything, including detailed trace messages

To change the log level:

1. In the "General Settings" section, find the "Log Level" setting.
2. Select the desired log level from the dropdown menu.

Higher log levels (Debug, Trace) generate more detailed logs, which can be useful for troubleshooting but may impact performance and consume more disk space.

### Auto-Start

- **Enabled**: Components start automatically
- **Disabled**: Components must be started manually

To change the auto-start setting:

1. In the "General Settings" section, find the "Auto Start" setting.
2. Toggle the switch to enable or disable auto-start.
