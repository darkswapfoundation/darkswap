# DarkSwap Bridge - Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for the DarkSwap Bridge project, including implementation details, priorities, and estimated timelines.

## 1. Implement REST API (Priority: High)

### Description
Implement a REST API for the bridge to allow external applications to interact with it. This will enable web and mobile applications to use the bridge without having to implement IPC communication.

### Implementation Details
- Use Axum for the REST API server
- Implement JWT authentication
- Implement rate limiting
- Implement API versioning
- Implement API documentation with Swagger

### Endpoints
- `/api/auth/login` - Authenticate with the API
- `/api/auth/register` - Register a new user (development only)
- `/api/bridge/wallet` - Wallet operations
- `/api/bridge/network` - Network operations
- `/api/bridge/orders` - Order operations
- `/api/bridge/trades` - Trade operations
- `/api/bridge/system` - System operations

### Estimated Timeline
- 2 weeks

## 2. Implement WebSocket API (Priority: High)

### Description
Implement a WebSocket API for real-time updates. This will enable web and mobile applications to receive real-time updates from the bridge without having to poll the REST API.

### Implementation Details
- Use Socket.IO for the WebSocket server
- Implement authentication
- Implement event filtering
- Implement reconnection logic

### Events
- `wallet_status` - Wallet status updates
- `network_status` - Network status updates
