# DarkSwap Consolidated Roadmap (Updated)

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for the DarkSwap project, consolidating information from various planning documents into a single source of truth.

## Project Overview

DarkSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes. It enables users to trade these assets without requiring a central server or authority, using WebRTC for browser-to-browser communication and circuit relay for NAT traversal.

## Timeline Overview

The DarkSwap project will be developed in five phases over approximately 6 months:

| Phase | Description | Duration | Start | End | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Phase 1 | Core SDK Implementation | 8 weeks | Month 1, Week 1 | Month 2, Week 4 | COMPLETED |
| Phase 2 | CLI and Daemon Implementation | 4 weeks | Month 3, Week 1 | Month 3, Week 4 | COMPLETED |
| Phase 3 | Web Interface Implementation | 6 weeks | Month 3, Week 3 | Month 4, Week 4 | IN PROGRESS |
| Phase 4 | Testing and Refinement | 4 weeks | Month 5, Week 1 | Month 5, Week 4 | PLANNED |
| Phase 5 | Documentation and Release | 4 weeks | Month 6, Week 1 | Month 6, Week 4 | PLANNED |

*Note: Phases 2 and 3 overlap by 2 weeks, as the CLI and daemon implementation can be completed while starting work on the web interface.*

| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Implement feature detection and fallback mechanisms |
| Bitcoin integration complexity | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing and validation |
| Resource availability | Medium | Low | Flexible timeline and resource allocation |

## Success Criteria

The DarkSwap project will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create and take orders for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes
2. Orders are distributed through the P2P network
3. Trades are executed securely using PSBTs
4. The platform works on desktop and web browsers
5. The platform is well-documented and easy to use

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Finish unit tests for core components, integration tests for API and WebSocket clients, and end-to-end tests for trade flow.
2. **Finalize Documentation**: Complete API documentation, component documentation, user guide, developer guide, and architecture documentation.
3. **Set Up Deployment**: Configure continuous integration and deployment, create Docker container for relay server, and set up production and staging environments.
4. **Enhance Accessibility**: Implement keyboard navigation, screen reader support, proper color contrast, focus management, and ARIA attributes.
5. **Ensure Browser Compatibility**: Test and fix issues in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers.
6. **Optimize Mobile Experience**: Improve mobile layout, touch interactions, viewport meta tags, media queries, and mobile-first design.
7. **Add Internationalization**: Set up translation system, language selection, RTL support, and date/number/currency formatting.

## Conclusion

This updated consolidated roadmap outlines the plan for developing the DarkSwap platform over a 6-month period. By following this roadmap, the project can be completed in a structured and efficient manner, with clear milestones and deliverables.

The roadmap is flexible and can be adjusted as needed based on progress, resource availability, and changing requirements. Regular reviews of the roadmap should be conducted to ensure that the project is on track and to make any necessary adjustments.

The project has made significant progress, with Phases 1 and 2 completed and Phase 3 well underway. The focus now is on completing the remaining tasks in Phase 3, particularly in the areas of testing, documentation, deployment, accessibility, browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, and internationalization.
