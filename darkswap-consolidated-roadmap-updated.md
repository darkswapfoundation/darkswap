# DarkSwap Consolidated Roadmap (Updated)

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for the DarkSwap project, consolidating information from various planning documents into a single source of truth.

## Project Overview

DarkSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes. It enables users to trade these assets without requiring a central server or authority, using WebRTC for browser-to-browser communication and circuit relay for NAT traversal.

## Timeline Overview

The DarkSwap project will be developed in five phases over approximately 6 months:

| Phase | Description | Duration | Start | End | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Phase 1 | Core SDK Implementation | 8 weeks | Month 1, Week 1 | Month 2, Week 4 | COMPLETED |
| Phase 2 | CLI and Daemon Implementation | 4 weeks | Month 3, Week 1 | Month 3, Week 4 | COMPLETED |
| Phase 3 | Web Interface Implementation | 6 weeks | Month 3, Week 3 | Month 4, Week 4 | IN PROGRESS |
| Phase 4 | Testing and Refinement | 4 weeks | Month 5, Week 1 | Month 5, Week 4 | PLANNED |
| Phase 5 | Documentation and Release | 4 weeks | Month 6, Week 1 | Month 6, Week 4 | PLANNED |

*Note: Phases 2 and 3 overlap by 2 weeks, as the CLI and daemon implementation can be completed while starting work on the web interface.*

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The following dependencies exist between components:

1. The CLI and daemon depend on the core SDK
2. The web interface depends on the TypeScript library
3. The TypeScript library depends on the WebAssembly bindings
4. The WebAssembly bindings depend on the core SDK
5. The relay server depends on the P2P networking code
6. Runes and alkanes support depend on the Bitcoin utilities module
7. The trade module depends on the orderbook module
8. The orderbook module depends on the network module

The critical path for the project is:

1. âœ… Complete the core SDK implementation
2. âœ… Create the CLI and daemon
3. ðŸ”„ Develop the web interface (IN PROGRESS)
   - âœ… Fix core SDK compilation issues
   - [ ] Complete WebAssembly bindings
   - [ ] Develop TypeScript library
   - [ ] Implement web interface components
4. [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing
5. [ ] Create documentation and prepare for release

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebRTC NAT traversal issues | High | Medium | Implement circuit relay and use STUN/TURN servers |
| WASM performance issues | Medium | Medium | Optimize critical paths and use web workers |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Implement feature detection and fallback mechanisms |
| Bitcoin integration complexity | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing and validation |
| Resource availability | Medium | Low | Flexible timeline and resource allocation |

## Success Criteria

The DarkSwap project will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create and take orders for Bitcoin, runes, and alkanes
2. Orders are distributed through the P2P network
3. Trades are executed securely using PSBTs
4. The platform works on desktop and web browsers
5. The platform is well-documented and easy to use

## Conclusion

This updated consolidated roadmap outlines the plan for developing the DarkSwap platform, with a focus on the current Phase 3 implementation. The core SDK compilation issues have been resolved, and the next steps involve completing the WebAssembly bindings, developing the TypeScript library, and implementing the web interface.

The roadmap is flexible and can be adjusted as needed based on progress, resource availability, and changing requirements. Regular reviews of the roadmap should be conducted to ensure that the project is on track and to make any necessary adjustments.
