# DarkSwap Phase 3 Immediate Next Steps

Based on the current project status and the updated roadmap, here are the immediate next steps for the DarkSwap Phase 3 implementation:

## 1. Testing

### Unit Tests for Core Components
- [ ] Create unit tests for BDK Wallet Integration
- [ ] Create unit tests for PSBT Handler
- [ ] Create unit tests for Rune Handler
- [ ] Create unit tests for Alkane Handler
- [ ] Create unit tests for Trade Protocol

**Approach**: Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript components and Rust's built-in testing framework for Rust components. Focus on testing core functionality and edge cases.

### Integration Tests for API Client
- [ ] Test API client initialization
- [ ] Test API client authentication
- [ ] Test API client error handling
- [ ] Test API client timeout handling
- [ ] Test API client response parsing

**Approach**: Use Jest and mock server responses to test API client functionality. Ensure all endpoints are covered.

### Integration Tests for WebSocket Client
- [ ] Test WebSocket client initialization
- [ ] Test WebSocket client connection
- [ ] Test WebSocket client reconnection
- [ ] Test WebSocket client message handling
- [ ] Test WebSocket client error handling

**Approach**: Use Jest and mock WebSocket server to test WebSocket client functionality. Focus on connection handling, message processing, and error recovery.

### End-to-End Tests for Trade Flow
- [ ] Test creating a trade offer
- [ ] Test viewing trade offers
- [ ] Test accepting a trade offer
- [ ] Test cancelling a trade offer
- [ ] Test trade execution
- [ ] Test trade history

**Approach**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing. Create test scenarios that cover the entire trade flow from creation to completion.

## 2. Documentation

### API Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Document API request/response formats
- [ ] Document API authentication
- [ ] Document API error codes
- [ ] Document API rate limits

**Approach**: Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation. Ensure all endpoints, parameters, and responses are documented.

### Component Documentation
- [ ] Document React components
- [ ] Document React hooks
- [ ] Document TypeScript types
- [ ] Document WebAssembly bindings
- [ ] Document Rust SDK

**Approach**: Use TypeDoc for TypeScript components and Rustdoc for Rust components. Include examples and usage patterns.

### User Guide
- [ ] Create getting started guide
- [ ] Create wallet setup guide
- [ ] Create trading guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create FAQ

**Approach**: Use Markdown for user guides. Include screenshots and step-by-step instructions.

## 3. Deployment

### Continuous Integration Setup
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure build steps
- [ ] Configure test steps
- [ ] Configure linting steps
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting

**Approach**: Create GitHub Actions workflows for CI. Ensure all tests are run on pull requests and main branch commits.

### Continuous Deployment Setup
- [ ] Set up deployment workflow
- [ ] Configure staging deployment
- [ ] Configure production deployment
- [ ] Configure rollback mechanism
- [ ] Configure deployment notifications

**Approach**: Extend GitHub Actions workflows for CD. Set up automatic deployment to staging and manual approval for production.

### Docker Container for Relay Server
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for relay server
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose for production
- [ ] Create Docker image build script
- [ ] Create Docker image push script

**Approach**: Create Docker configuration files for relay server. Ensure proper configuration for different environments.

## 4. Security Enhancements

### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement client-side error handling
- [ ] Implement server-side error handling
- [ ] Implement WebAssembly error handling
- [ ] Implement API error handling
- [ ] Implement WebSocket error handling

**Approach**: Create consistent error handling patterns across all components. Ensure errors are logged and reported appropriately.

### Logging
- [ ] Implement client-side logging
- [ ] Implement server-side logging
- [ ] Implement WebAssembly logging
- [ ] Implement API logging
- [ ] Implement WebSocket logging

**Approach**: Use a centralized logging system. Ensure all components log errors, warnings, and important events.

### Authentication
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Implement API authentication
- [ ] Implement WebSocket authentication
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Implement token refresh

**Approach**: Use JWT for authentication. Ensure secure token storage and proper session management.

### Authorization
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Implement permission-based access control
- [ ] Implement API authorization
- [ ] Implement WebSocket authorization
- [ ] Implement resource-based authorization

**Approach**: Use the role-based access control system. Define roles and permissions for different user types.

## 5. Performance Optimization

### WebAssembly Size Optimization
- [ ] Optimize WebAssembly binary size
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Implement tree shaking
- [ ] Implement dead code elimination

**Approach**: Use wasm-opt and other optimization tools. Measure binary size before and after optimization.

### React Component Memoization
- [ ] Implement React.memo for functional components
- [ ] Implement shouldComponentUpdate for class components
- [ ] Implement useMemo for computed values
- [ ] Implement useCallback for event handlers
- [ ] Implement context optimization

**Approach**: Profile React components and identify performance bottlenecks. Apply memoization techniques to expensive components.

### API Response Caching
- [ ] Implement client-side caching
- [ ] Implement server-side caching
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation
- [ ] Implement cache revalidation
- [ ] Implement cache prefetching

**Approach**: Use browser cache and memory cache for client-side caching. Use Redis or similar for server-side caching.

### Lazy Loading of Components
- [ ] Implement React.lazy for component loading
- [ ] Implement Suspense for loading states
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Implement feature-based code splitting
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports

**Approach**: Use React.lazy and Suspense for component loading. Split code by routes and features.
