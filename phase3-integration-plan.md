# DarkSwap Phase 3 Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the various components of Phase 3 (relay server, WebAssembly bindings, TypeScript library, and web interface) into a cohesive system.

## Overview

Phase 3 consists of four main components:

1. **Relay Server (darkswap-relay)**: Provides WebRTC signaling and circuit relay for NAT traversal
2. **WebAssembly Bindings (darkswap-web-sys)**: Allows the Rust SDK to run in web browsers
3. **TypeScript Library (darkswap-lib)**: Provides a JavaScript/TypeScript API for web applications
4. **Web Interface (web)**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the DarkSwap network

The integration process will ensure these components work together seamlessly to provide a complete decentralized trading experience.
