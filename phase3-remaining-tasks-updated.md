## How to Prompt for Next Steps

When you're ready to continue working on the DarkSwap project, you can prompt me with specific tasks from the remaining tasks list. Here are some examples of how to prompt me:

### For WebAssembly Build and Integration:
```
Let's implement the actual WebAssembly bindings for the Rust functions in darkswap_wasm.ts
```

### For Wallet Integration Enhancements:
```
Let's enhance the wallet integration by implementing actual wallet creation and import functionality
```

### For Trading Functionality:
```
Let's implement the actual order creation and execution functionality in the Trade page
```

### For P2P Network Enhancements:
```
Let's implement the actual P2P network connection and peer discovery
```

### For Security Enhancements:
```
Let's implement secure key management and transaction validation
```

### For User Experience Improvements:
```
Let's improve the user experience by adding loading indicators and responsive design
```

### For Testing and Quality Assurance:
```
Let's add unit tests for the WebAssembly integration and wallet functionality
```

### For Documentation and Deployment:
```
Let's create comprehensive API documentation and user guides
```

You can also combine multiple tasks or be more specific about what you want to work on. For example:
```
Let's implement the actual order creation functionality and add order matching algorithm
```

Or:
```
Let's focus on security by implementing secure key management and adding transaction validation
```

I'll then help you implement the requested functionality step by step, providing code, explanations, and guidance along the way.
